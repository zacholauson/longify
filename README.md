This app was a idea by [Abraham Sangha](https://github.com/abrahamsangha) and I while attending Dev Bootcamp. This app is like Bitly but the complete opposite, you give it a link and it gives you a much longer link. We built a version in Sinatra, but now I wanted to go back and rebuild it in Rails.

tl;dr: Give it a url and it will give you a longer url
